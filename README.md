# EntitySystem

This is my new Entity System

(To see the old one: https://github.com/Cmdu76/Aharos/tree/master/Source/EntitySystem )

SFML is needed ! (System & Network at least)

- Messaging system (using sf::Packet as message, to be online and to have message containing what you want)
- Easy to be used for online games
- No class for entity, entities are just ids

Take a look at the examples :

In /test1 : You will find an easy system to move a sprite

In /test2 : You will find a system to move this sprite using network feature
